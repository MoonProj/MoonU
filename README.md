# MoonU

## Overview
MoonU is a universal MelonLoader mod that provides a Roblox executor-like experience for modding Unity games. It uses MoonSharp to allow for dynamic Lua script execution within Unity games, offering a powerful and flexible modding interface.

- Lua script execution using MoonSharp
- User-friendly interface for script input and execution
- Real-time feedback and error reporting

## Name Clarification
It's important to note that the similarity between the names "MoonSharp" and "MoonU" is purely coincidental. 

- **MoonSharp** is an existing Lua interpreter for .NET and Unity, which this project utilizes.
- **MoonU** (this project) is named independently and is not officially associated with MoonSharp.

The "Moon" in MoonU does not imply any official connection to MoonSharp. We chose this name for our project separately, and any resemblance is unintentional.

## Status
**Note: This project is currently under development.**

The source code and executable will be made available soon. We're working hard to ensure a stable and feature-rich initial release.

## Planned Release
- Source Code: Coming Soon
- Executable: Coming Soon

We appreciate your interest and patience. Stay tuned for updates!
